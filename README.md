This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of projects I've completed as part of my **Skill Development Course (SDC)**. It represents a significant effort in mastering various web development technologies.

Within this collection, you'll find a range of full-stack projects, each designed to build practical skills and deepen my understanding of core concepts. The technologies explored include:

* **React:** For building dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
* **Node.js:** For developing robust server-side applications and APIs.
* **Django:** Leveraging Python's powerful framework for web development.
* **HTML & CSS:** The fundamental building blocks, styled and structured effectively.
* **JavaScript:** Bringing interactivity and advanced functionality to life.

Each project aligns with the SDC curriculum, demonstrating my progress and ability to apply learned principles in real-world scenarios.
